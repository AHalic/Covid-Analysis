This is a Covd Analysis made by Debora Ghiotti and Sophie Dilhon for Data Science class.

# Data
The data were collected from the state of Espirito Santo [official's covid pannel](https://coronavirus.es.gov.br/painel-covid-19-es)

# Covid-Analysis

In this analysis we first tried clustering the data searching for groups of people at higher risk from covid-19.
As we couldn't do so, we then changed the approach to clustering based on the neighborhood total of covid cases and deaths over time.

# Conclusion

Based in our analysis we concluded that there is indeed a group of neighborhoods considered at a higher risk, and as seen with the new omicron, 
they are the most affected by new covid waves. Thus, the government should reunite forces to focus on those groups ans reduce de virus mortality.
